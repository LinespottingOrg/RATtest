          Relational Awareness Theory (RAT) is a framework designed to help
          individuals and organizations better understand the dynamics of their
          relationships. This theory emphasizes that our interactions are shaped
          by more than just personal motivationsâ€”our actions are deeply
          influenced by the relationships we maintain with others, whether in
          personal, social, or professional contexts.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4 md:font-semibold md:text-xl">
          The goal of Relational Awareness Theory is to help individuals
          recognize the complexity of relationships, leading to more meaningful
          interactions, improved communication, and deeper connections. It also
          provides a valuable lens for understanding conflict, collaboration,
          and leadership in various social structures, such as in the workplace
          or within families.
