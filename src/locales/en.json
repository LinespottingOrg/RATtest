This theory emphasizes that our interactions are shaped by more than just personal motivations – our actions are deeply influenced by the relationships we have with others, whether in personal, social, or professional contexts.",
      "description_text_2": "The goal of Relational Awareness Theory is to help individuals recognize the complexity of relationships, leading to more meaningful interactions, improved communication, and deeper connections. It also provides a valuable perspective for understanding conflict, collaboration, and leadership in various social structures, such as in the workplace or within families."
